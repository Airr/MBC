### BCX LICENSE EXCEPTION

As a special exception, the BCX license gives permission for additional uses of the text contained in its release of BCX. The exception is that, if you use BCX to create source code that will link the BCX libraries with other files to produce an executable, this does not by itself cause the resulting executable to be covered by the GNU GPL. Your use of that executable is in no way restricted on account of using BCX to produce source code that will link the BCX library code into it.

This exception does not invalidate any other reasons why the executable file might be covered by the GNU General Public License. This exception applies only to the code released with this BCX explicit exception. If you add or copy code from other sources, as the General Public License permits, the above exception does not apply to the code that you add in this way.

To avoid misleading anyone as to the status of such modified files, you must delete this exception notice from them. If you write modifications of your own for BCX, it is your choice whether to permit this exception to apply to your modifications.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; WITHOUT EVEN THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
